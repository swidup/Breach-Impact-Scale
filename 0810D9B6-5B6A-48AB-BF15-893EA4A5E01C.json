  "summary": "Some patients referred to Tennova Cardiology by Summitt Medical Center are being warned that their personal information may have been stolen.  According to a press release from Tennova, a laptop belonging to an independent, third-party transcription contractor was stolen from a vehicle in Nashville on October 22.  \"Tennova Cardiology has no reason to believe that this information has been accessed or misused in a way that would cause harm to the affected patients. The unencrypted laptop contained data from patients referred to Tennova Cardiology by Summit Medical Group for cardiac diagnostic tests. The diagnostic tests were performed at the Summit diagnostic services locations,\" the release said.  Tennova said they are working to identify all patients whose information may have been on the laptop and has mailed a letter to the 2,777 patients who may have been affected.  The information on the stolen laptop may include names, dates of birth, referring physician names, and health information about patient treatment and diagnostic procedures. There is no evidence that any Social Security numbers were included in the information contained on the laptop.  The contractor is no longer performing services for the physician group.  If you think your information may have been compromised, you can call (866) 369-0422 for more information.",
