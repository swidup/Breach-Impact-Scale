  "summary": "The Department of Public Health is working to notify patients whose records were wrongfully removed from San Francisco General Hospital by a former UC San Francisco physician who worked at the hospital from 2005 to 2013. Public health officials learned of the security breach Feb. 13, and the health department is providing written notification to all affected patients, DPH spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said in a statement Friday. UCSF is cooperating with the health department to return the records and secure the identities of the affected patients, health officials said. The California Department of Public Health, the California Attorney General, the California Medical Board and the Office of Civil Rights have all been notified of the breach. The physician worked at the hospital from 2005 to 2013.  Department spokeswoman Rachel Kagan said she does not know how many records the physician took or the reason why the physician took the records. UCSF officials are working with health department officials to recover the records.",
