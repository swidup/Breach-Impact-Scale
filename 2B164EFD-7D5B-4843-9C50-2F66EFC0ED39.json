  "summary": "An employee dispute at the Human Services Agency of San Francisco has resulted in an information breach affecting about 2,400 Medi-Cal beneficiaries, the San Francisco Examiner reports. Medi-Cal is California's Medicaid program. Trent Rhorer, the agency's director, said the breach occurred when a former San Francisco employee e-mailed records to her personal computer, two attorneys and two union representatives. The former employee, who had been terminated for performance issues, was attempting to demonstrate that she had faced a disproportionately high caseload, Rhorer said. He noted that the records contained Medi-Cal beneficiaries' names, Social Security numbers and other identifying information. According to Rhorer, the records were \"extremely contained\" and did not include sensitive medical or health benefit information. Rhorer said affected beneficiaries would receive letters about the breach",
