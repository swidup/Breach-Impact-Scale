The seller is \"TheDarkOverlord,\" who provided descriptions of the databases and samples, but did not name the victim entities.  DataBreaches.net was able to contact TheDarkOverlord and asked for a response to AOC's statement. He (they) acknowledged that they had sent a reminder email about the ransom earlier today, and that they had made it clear in the email that they were the hackers. They also disputed AOC's statement that they first became aware of the breach 48 hours ago.",
