  "summary": "UC Davis Health System officials are notifying 1,800 patients that their personal or medical information may be compromised after three doctors were hit with an email phishing scam.  The physicians' email accounts were exposed to malicious software in the mid-December security breach, health system spokesperson Charles Casey said. He said the doctors assumed the email came from the I-T department when they opened it but instead were phishing scams.  The emails contained patients' names, medical record numbers and limited information associated with a clinic or hospital visits. The emails did not list credit card or Social Security numbers.  The doctors first noticed the problem when emails disappeared from their accounts. Emails also were sent from their accounts to people outside of the health system, Casey said.  Some patients at UC Davis Medical Center said they were still concerned about the incident.  \"It's a little scary, still not good for the people who come here, \" UC Davis Medical Center visitor Luis Baron said.
