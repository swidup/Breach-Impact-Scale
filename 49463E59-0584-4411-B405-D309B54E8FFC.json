  "summary": "Veteran A contacted local VA Police over the weekend to report that he had received a package for Veteran B at the home he recently moved into in the last few weeks. Veteran B left no forwarding address. Veteran A attempted to contact the local VA Pharmacy about the issue and was forwarded to a VA employee who told him the package did not contain any medications. Veteran A was told the box only contained adult diapers. The Veteran has reported to the local Privacy Officer his concerns of this disclosure being a Privacy violation.\nThe Pharmacy Service is attempting to contact Veteran B to acquire his new address to re-send the supplies, but there is not an address for next of kin or emergency contacts in the record and the one phone number available is disconnected.",
