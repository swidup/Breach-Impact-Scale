  "summary": "An employee was leaving a patient's house for home oxygen treatment and loading up the truck. He set a piece of paper with the patient's Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on the side of the truck, forgot the paper was there, got back in the vehicle and drove back to the VA. When he got back he noticed the sheet was missing and went back to try to find it. He could not locate the sheet. The Veteran notified the facility that his neighbor retrieved the document and returned the document to the Veteran. VA staff went out and retrieved the document from the Veteran.",
