  "summary": "The BitTorrent Client uTorrent, established by Ludvig Strigeus and later acquired by BitTorrent Inc., has issued a warning to its users regarding a security breach of their forum which allowed hackers to steal user information and password hashes of the site. Naturally, uTorrent has urged its users to immediately change their passwords.  \"As a precaution, we are advising our users to change their passwords.\"  The breach, as per the advisory alert published by uTorrent, occurred on 6th June after the company was alerted about the breach by the software vendor of the forum. The forum uses an IP.Board and a cloud-based service as cited by SoftPedia.  Attackers have downloaded information of all uTorrent users although it is unclear what sort of data has been downloaded. uTorrent's team believes that all of its passwords have been stolen  even those that were hashed.  \"While the passwords may not be used as a vector on the forums, those hashed passwords should be considered compromised,\" says uTorrent.  However, what we do know is that uTorrent has hundreds of thousands of registered users, approximately 385,000. The announcement read that it was very important to reset passwords especially if users were using same credentials for multiple services.  \"Anyone using the same password for forums as well as other places is strongly advised to update their passwords and/or practice good personal security practices.\"  If you have an account on uTorrent change your password ASAP before it's too late!",
