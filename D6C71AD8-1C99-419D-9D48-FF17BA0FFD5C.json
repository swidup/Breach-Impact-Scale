  "summary": "A 29 month prison sentence was handed down on Tuesday to a Colorado man who pleaded guilty to charges involving a massive photo hacking scheme.  Brandon Bourret, of Colorado Springs, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud.  The FBI tracked Bourret and a colleague down after a total of 1.9 million Photobucket accounts were found to be hacked.  \"All I hear is 'Brandon, wake up! The FBI is here.' They broke in the doors,\" Bourret told CBS4's Rick Sallinger outside the courthouse on Tuesday.  For $20, Bourret had been providing a computer program to access Photobucket accounts designated on as private.  Bourret told CBS4 he didn't realize what he was doing was illegal.  \"I would have had the plug pulled faster than you can get a pizza delivered to your house,\" he said.  But in court, prosecutors said many of the pictures were pornographic and available for extortion. Some were sent to family and co-workers.  ",
