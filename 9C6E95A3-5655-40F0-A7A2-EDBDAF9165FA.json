  "summary": "Wisconsins Memorial Hospital of Lafayette County has posted notice on its website that it mailed out 8,000 data breach notification letters to patients after it learned on Aug. 6, 2013 that some of their financial statements had been inadvertently sent out to the wrong people by a third-party billing vendor.  Credit should be given to Memorial Hospital of Lafayette County in that it didnt bury its breach notification letter, posted by PHIPrivacy.net here, on its website and instead its on the middle of its home page. The notice says that there was an erroneous setting in the vendors system and the system generated a number of zero balance or aged account balance statements relating to care provided at the hospital since 2001 and these bills were sometimes sent to wrong or outdated addresses.",
