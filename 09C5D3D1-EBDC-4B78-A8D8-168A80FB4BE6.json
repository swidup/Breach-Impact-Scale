  "summary": "Authorities say Edwin Vargas logged onto a federal criminal and terrorist database and ran names for reasons that had nothing to do with his duties as a New York Police Department detective. Instead, he was accused in May of looking up personal information on two fellow officers without their knowledge. At least two times, he used the NIRC database without authorization to look up information on two officers whose private email accounts he'd secretly obtained, authorities said. Prosecutors didn't give a motive, but police officials suggested he was looking to see who his ex-girlfriend, also a police officer, was chatting with. His lawyer said he was \"shocked\" by the allegations.",
