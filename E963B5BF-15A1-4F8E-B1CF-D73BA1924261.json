  "summary": "Patient A received a prescription intended for Patient B. Patient Bs name and type of medication was compromised. Patient A reported the incident to the medical center and a replacement has been requested for Patient B.

There were a total of 4 Mis-Mailed CMOP incidents out of 6,213,592 total packages (9,108,556 total prescriptions) mailed out for this reporting period.
