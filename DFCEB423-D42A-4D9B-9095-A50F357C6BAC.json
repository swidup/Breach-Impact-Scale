Review of the file and folder indicate no one unauthorized viewed the file. This was a policy violation. No data breach occurred.\n07/30/12:\nPer request from the PO, the employee will be offered a letter offering Credit Protection Services, due to the potential that someone may have been able to view the file while it was on the public drive, and the file contained the full name and SSN of the employee.",
