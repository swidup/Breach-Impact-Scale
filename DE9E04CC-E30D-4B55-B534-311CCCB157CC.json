  "summary": "Florida's Sight and Sun Eyeworks Gulf Breeze recently began notifying 9,000 patients that their personal information had been accessed inappropriately (h/t HealthITSecurity).  In a statement on its Web site [PDF file], Sight and Sun stated that patients' names, addresses, Social Security numbers and medical records were accessed and copied.  \"Sight and Sun Eyeworks Gulf Breeze has learned that its patients' information has been used by an unauthorized individual or company to contact patients to offer other medical services,\" the statement reads. \"Sight and Sun Eyeworks Gulf Breeze believes the records were accessed only to offer other medical services and not to commit identity theft. However, patients should closely monitor their credit card, bank and other financial statements for signs of fraud and identity theft.\"  According to the Pensacola News Journal, Sight and Sun Eyeworks is suing former employees Dr. Suzanne M. Day and Lynette Bramlett for taking patient data with them in order to solicit patients when they left to work for a competing optometry office.  Patients with questions or concerns are advised to call (855) 408-4746.",
