  "summary": "On Feb. 20 Ketty Placide went to Greenwich Police Headquarters to meet with officers regarding a larceny in Greenwich that she was charged with last November. She was taken into custody on an active arrest warrant for the November larceny.  Placide was processed for Illegal Use of a Credit Card (26 Counts), Receiving Goods/Services Obtained Illegally (26 Counts), Credit Card Theft (26 Counts), Criminal Impersonation (30 Counts), Forgery 1st Degree (4 Counts), Identity Theft 1st Degree (30 Counts), Larceny 2nd and Threatening. She  was assigned a court date of February 27, 2015 at Stamford Superior Court.  According to Greenwich Police the arrest stems back to an incident on West Church Street in Byram on Nov. 13, 2014, when Placide was employed by Synergy HomeCare as a home health care worker. Placide had contracted to provide care for a disabled person and stole checks, credit cards, and jewelry from the victim she was supposed to be caring for.  According to police, Placide used the stolen checks and credit cards to make numerous purchases of hair care products and clothing for her personal use. Placide also used the victims biographical information to steal her identity and fraudulently obtain credit cards in the victims name. After the initial report of the thefts, Placide allegedly made threats via an electronic medium to harm the victim for reporting the incident to the police.",
