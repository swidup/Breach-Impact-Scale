  "summary": " Two USB hard drives containing personally-identifiable Veteran information were stolen from a Veterans Health Administration contract employee in Oklahoma on July 18, 2017. The Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane has notified 1915 Veterans whose information might have been compromised.  The employee was at a service call at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center when the hard drives were stolen. The employee filed a local police report.  One of the stolen hard drives was the Master Drive used to copy and move the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center's Anesthesia Record Keeper database from a physical server that was not connected to a network. The information was archived during the week of January 16, 2017.  The Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center can not say exactly what information was stored on the USB, but every Veteran whose information was on the old server has been notified by letter, just in case. An offer of credit monitoring for one year at no charge will also be offered to certain Veterans.  The information at risk could include full names, social security numbers, addresses, phone contacts, and surgical and insurance information.",
