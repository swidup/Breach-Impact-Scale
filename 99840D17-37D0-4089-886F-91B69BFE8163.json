  "summary": "Illinois-based Barrington Orthopedic Specialists is notifying more than a thousand patients that a laptop and EMG machine containing their personal information were stolen.  How many victims? 1,009.  What type of personal information? Names, dates of birth, and EMG results and reports.  What happened? A laptop and EMG machine containing the personal information were stolen from a Barrington Orthopedic Specialists transport vehicle.  What was the response? The theft has been reported to the police and they are investigating. Additional equipment has been acquired so transportation of units is no longer necessary. Data sets are no longer being maintained on laptops associated with EMG machines, and instead will be maintained on the internal server system. Procedures and practices are being reviewed and revised. All affected patients are being notified.  Details: The theft was discovered on Aug. 18, and the laptop and EMG machine are believed to have been stolen sometime between Aug. 14 and Aug. 18.  Quote: \"Due to the limited information contained on the unit, we do not believe there is any financial identity risks as only name and birthdate and test results were breached,\" a notification posted to the Barrington Orthopedic Specialists said.  Source: A Wednesday correspondence with a Barrington Orthopedics Specialists spokesperson; barringtonortho.com, \"HIPAA Patient Letter,\" Sept. 25, 2015.",
