  "summary": "A laptop valued at $4,000 was reported stolen from the Midwest Urological Group on Tuesday. According to a police report, the laptop contained patient information on its hard drive. An employee of the group contacted police Tuesday after noticing a laptop used by employees had been missing for a day. The laptop was connected to a larger piece of equipment, but only the laptop was stolen, according to the report. The laptop was reported to contain information on patients treated at the facility and expensive medical software. The last employee to have used the laptop told police he may have inadvertently left the storage closet that houses the equipment and laptop unlocked. Employees told police the laptop was stolen between noon Saturday and 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.",
