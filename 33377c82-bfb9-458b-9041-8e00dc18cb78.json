The store \"inadvertently disposed of\" an electronic signature device used in the store's pharmacy in February 2016, resulting in the breach, according to a press release by ShopRite parent company Wakefern.   Customers who filled a prescription at the pharmacy between 2005 and 2015 were required to sign the device, and the device also stored data of customers who purchased over-the-counter medicine.",
