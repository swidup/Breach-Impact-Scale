The laptop contained clients' demographic information.  After the incident, the CE performed a risk analysis of the specific breach occurrence.  The CE provided OCR with a copy of its risk analysis, as well as its privacy, breach notification, and security policies and procedures. Following OCR's investigation, the CE performed a broader security risk assessment and encrypted all mobile media.  The CE also developed and provided computer security training to its staff members.",
