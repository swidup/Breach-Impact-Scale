  "summary": "The Houston Chronicle is reporting that sources say that at least one stolen electronic file containing sensitive personal information on thousands of current and former Harris County employees was found in Vietnam by the FBI.  County sources spoke under condition of anonymity to the paper, saying that at least one of the breached files had been found by the federal agency in Vietnam.  First Assistant County Attorney Robert Soard declined to confirm the FBI was the agency that contacted the county two weeks ago concerning the files. A FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Saturday to The Associated Press Saturday.  The two breached files, created in 2005 and 2007, held names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and hire dates of 21,000 employees working at the county at those times.",
