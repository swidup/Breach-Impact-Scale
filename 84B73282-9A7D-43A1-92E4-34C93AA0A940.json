  "summary": "A former home health care personal nursing assistant from St. Louis has been ordered to spend three years in federal prison for defrauding an 82-year-old patient. Federal prosecutors say 37-year-old Melissa Charlton pleaded guilty last May in East St. Louis, Illinois, to charges of access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. Authorities say that Charlton got access to the credit cards and checking account of the victim from OFallon, Illinois, and misused them. Prosecutors say that after the victim discovered the fraudulent purchases, Charlton stole the replacement credit cards and used the victims Social Security number and birthdate to activate them and to get an additional credit card account. Charlton also was ordered to pay nearly $5,300 in restitution.   Read more: http://www.kmov.com/news/crime/St-Louis-woman-gets-3-years-for-fraud-identity-theft-293817221.html#ixzz3T0wfFrQi",
