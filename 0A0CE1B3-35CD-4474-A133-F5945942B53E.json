  "summary": "The last of five people accused of tax refund fraud involving identity theft from medical records pleaded guilty Friday for his role in the scheme, U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer said.  Michael Ali Bryant, Sr., 41, of Lauderdale Lakes, faces up to 12 years in prison at his sentencing scheduled in April, prosecutors said.  A confidential informant approached Bryant to buy drugs through Bryants connection to a medical service provider. Bryant said he had no access to any drugs but he could sell medical records containing the personal information of hundreds of patients that could be used to file fraudulent income tax returns, according to court documents.  Bryant sold the source 10 pages with up to 25 names on each and gave specific instructions on how to file the tax returns online to get tax refunds in the patients names without their knowledge, the court records showed.  According to the complaint, Rosier worked for a company that performed medical laboratory tests where she had access to medical records with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individuals in the course of her employment with that company. During the conspiracy, Rosier provided access to the companys database which allowed other coconspirators to steal PII from the company. Found on the computer of one of the coconspirators was the PII of over 1,300 individuals. Rosier knew that her co-conspirators would use the PII for fraudulent purposes. Moye also obtained information from the companys database, which he used to obtain credit cards and other identification in the name of a patient.",
