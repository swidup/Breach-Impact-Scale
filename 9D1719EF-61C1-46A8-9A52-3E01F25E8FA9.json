  "summary": "A Wyoming medical billing firm is trying to contact patients of one of its clients that a vehicle theft could result in a data breach of customer information.  Insurance Data Services, at 1161 58th St. in Wyoming, says a West Michigan Delivery Service courier car delivering account information for a client was stolen Sept. 15 at Zondervan Publishing in Kentwood.  Camera footage shows a man with a mask and gloves getting into vehicle, company officials say. The car was later found in Kentwood, but police are still looking for suspect. Items in the delivery vehicle haven't been found yet, according to an IDS spokeswoman.  The missing documents include information about a portion of Claystone Clinical Associates' 2,900 patients. The documents include patients' names, phone number, addresses, diagnoses code, treatment codes, insurer and account balances.",
