  "summary": "Officials at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital are notifying almost 600 patients after it was discovered that a former employee accessed patient records last month.  The hospital says 594 patients will receive individual letters notifying them of the breach, after it was discovered that between April 1, 2013, and April 1 of this year, an employee accessed records of the patients without a valid reason, including names, dates of birth and diagnoses.  ProMedica Bay Park Hospital values patient privacy and deeply regrets that this incident occurred, ProMedica wrote in a prepared statement. The hospital is taking this matter very seriously. ProMedica immediately deactivated the employees access to patient information and the individual is no longer employed by ProMedica.  ProMedica Bay Park Hospital has completed an internal investigation and is taking precautions to prevent any further health information breaches. This includes additional training for employees to ensure they understand and follow patient information access policies.  Hospital officials said the employee accessed such things as hospital visit and medical record numbers, medications and other clinical information, but did not access financial information for the patients.   Included in the letter is information offering each patient a free, one-year membership for identity theft protection services. ",
