  "summary": "The letter sent out to customers doesn't specify what happened. It only notes that certain Experian consumer information \"may have been accessed without proper authorization.\" The data includes names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth and account numbers.  Experian is working with Defense Contracts South and law enforcement on investigating the incident. Experian is providing two years of complementary credit monitoring and report through the company's ProtectMyID Elite product.  DataBreaches believes someone might have compromised Defense Contracts South database login credentials.  It's also worth noting that Experian doesn't usually offer complementary enrollment in the ProtectMyID service. This means that the company has either changed its incident response plan, or this breach is more serious than it appears to be.",
