  "summary": "The following information of 5 patients participating in a research protocol was sent to the SPRINT Central Database at Wake Forest University. Name, age, ethnicity and blood pressure were entered in the database without the patient signing an informed consent of HIPAA release forms. There is difficulty in identifying two (2) of the patients. One of them could not be identified because he was ineligible. There are too many patients with the same name as the second, so he can't be identified.",
