  "summary": "A patient is suing RestorixHealth LLC, also known as St. Mary's Regional Wound Center, citing alleged breach of fiduciary duty and confidentiality.  Jill C. Barber filed a complaint on Feb. 27 in the Cabell Circuit Court against the center, alleging that the medical provider violated the West Virginia Code.  According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that as a result of defendant's negligence, she has been irreparably harmed and was caused to suffer extreme emotional distress, aggravation, annoyance and inconvenience. The plaintiff holds RestorixHealth responsible because the defendant allegedly carelessly disclosed the plaintiff's confidential information to a third party, without a court order.",
