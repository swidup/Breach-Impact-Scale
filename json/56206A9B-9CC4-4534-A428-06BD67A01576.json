  "summary": "Patient A received a prescription intended for Patient B. Patient Bs name and type of medication was compromised. Patient A reported the incident to the medical center and a replacement has been requested for Patient B. Charleston Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) investigation concludes that this was a CMOP packing error. The CMOP employee will be counseled and retrained in proper packing procedures.  This is informational for Mis-Mailed CMOP incidents and is the representative ticket. There were a total of 9 Mis-Mailed CMOP incidents out of 8,070,233 total packages (11,777,227 total prescriptions) mailed out for this reporting period. Because of repetition, the other 8 are not included in this report, but are included in the \"Mis-Mailed CMOP Incidents\" count at the end of this report. In all incidents, Veterans will receive a notification letter.",
