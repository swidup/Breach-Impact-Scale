  "summary": "New West Health Services d/b/a New West Medicare has unfortunately learned of an incident involving a company laptop computer that was stolen from an off-site location. The computer contained electronic files with personal information from past and present New West customers. The computer was password protected, and there is no evidence to suggest that the information stored on the laptop was the target of the theft or that any customer information has been accessed or misused.  Once we learned of the theft, New West took immediate action including initiating an internal investigation and notifying law enforcement. We also retained Navigant, a leading national computer forensic firm, to assist us in our investigation.  Based on the forensic investigation, New West believes that the laptop contained customers' names, addresses and, in certain instances, driver's license numbers and Social Security numbers or Medicare claim numbers. The laptop may have also contained limited information related to some individuals' payment of Medicare premiums, including electronic funds transfer information (bank account number, account holder name, account type and bank routing number) or credit card information (card holder name, credit card account number, expiration date and CVV (\"Card Verification Value\") number). Additionally, the laptop may have contained some customers' health information, including dates of birth, medical history and condition, diagnosis and/or prescription information.",
