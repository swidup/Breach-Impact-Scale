  "summary": "American Family Care of Birmingham is alerting customers following the theft of two laptops containing sensitive information from an employees vehicle earlier this summer. The laptops contain information concerning work-related injuries, physicals, immunizations and drug screens and were stolen in Marietta, Ga., according to a release from AFC. The company also wanted customers to know the information did not pertain to general primary or urgent care visits and were not used in direct patient care.  The company also stated no evidence points to the information being accessed, but it was discovered in August that the laptops might contain certain patient information, such as patient names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, medical record numbers, social security numbers, medical information, insurance information, drivers license numbers and dates of service relating to a select group of AFC patients. Those who may have had information on the laptop will be notified via letter and will also be given access to resources to protect themselves from identity and information theft, the release said.",
