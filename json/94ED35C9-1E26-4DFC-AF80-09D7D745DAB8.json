  "summary": "A cashier at the Staples in Mamaroneck has been charged with stealing, then selling, 50 customers' credit card numbers, leading to $181,800 in credit card fraud, according to a Westchester County Police press release.  Valerie Fajardo, a 21-year-old from the Bronx, was arrested at the store on 2444 Boston Post Road on Tuesday at 1:45 p.m. by Westchester County Police. She is accused of using a skimming device to capture the credit card information. Police seized the device at Fajardo's Morris Avenue home.  According to the press release, she sold the information to a third party, who used it to open credit cards in the name of those 50 customers between May and December of 2011. The fraud totaled $181,800.  Fajardo faces criminal possession of a forgery device and first-degree scheme to defraud, both felonies. She also faces 50 counts of unlawful possession of personal identification and 50 counts of petit larceny, both misdemeanors.   She was arraigned Thursday in Larchmont Village Court and is being held at the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla until she can make bail.",
