  "summary": "Following a recent trend of tax fraud resulting from patient data breaches, there are now more details regarding the patient data breach at South Miami Hospital involving 834 patients that occurred between June of 2011 and February 2012.  Photos have now surfaced of convicted identity thieves Alci Bonannee and Chante Mozley taking money derived from stolen tax refunds out of Florida banks. According to NBCMiami.com, those refunds belonged to Joseph Szot and can be traced back to his identity being stolen while he was a patient at South Miami Hospital. Bonannee and Mozley allegedly paid South Miami Hospital respiratory therapist Betty Cole for patient data that included Social Security numbers.  Baptist Health, which owns South Miami Hospital, released this statement back on Mar. 1 (via PHIPrivacy.net):  Baptist Health says its privacy office has recently learned that a South Miami Hospital employee inappropriately accessed 834 patient records.  According to the hospital, the records, dated from June 2011 through February 2012, included patient names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.  The breach came to light during a collaborative investigation with federal law enforcement officials.  The hospital said the investigation showed that the employee disclosed information to individuals involved in filing fraudulent tax returns.  The South Miami Hospital employee has been terminated, and efforts are underway to prosecute the individual to the fullest extent possible, said the hospital. The only details previously available had been the hospital stating that the employee disclosed information to individuals involved in filing fraudulent tax returns. NBC 6 said that it reached out to Betty Cole but she refused to be interviewed.",
