  "summary": "A ROI clerk mailed medical records belonging to Veteran A to an attorney's office that had requested medical records on Veteran B. Veteran A notified VAMC that he received medical records belonging to Veteran B. Veteran A returned Veteran B's medical records to VAMC. The PO contacted the Attorney's office. Since the requesting Paralegal was out of the office a brief message of the incident was left on voice mail and requested a return call tomorrow to the PO. Attorney's administrative office staff indicated a package was received from the VAMC today and the package remains unopened pending the Paralegal's return tomorrow. The medical records included Veteran B's name, home address, date of birth, PHI and social security number.\nIncident Update\n07/09/10:\nThe ROI clerk is off-duty today and unable to answer further questions regarding whether she copied Veteran A's information and sent to another requestor.
