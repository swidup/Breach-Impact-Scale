  "summary": "Veteran A notified the VA Gulf Coast as receiving \"opened\" mail containing their information and information belonging to 4 other Veterans. The Privacy Officer was immediately notified and telephoned Veteran A. Arrangements are being made to obtain the information as soon as possible. Due to the proximity of the veteran's home and CBOCs, arrangements will be made first thing in the morning. Veteran A has agreed for a CBOC employee to retrieve the information from their home. The veteran lives alone and ensures the information is secured and not accessible to anyone. Veteran A indicated the package was \"opened\" as if the mail was not sealed appropriately. They indicated the postal worker also made a comment about the package being \"opened\". It is noted due to heavy rains and high humility other mail received by the recipient was been partially opened.",
