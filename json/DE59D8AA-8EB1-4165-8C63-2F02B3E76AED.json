  "summary": "Several employees at Spectrum Health have been terminated over a picture posted on Facebook.  A source tells WZZM 13 News that an off-duty employee was in the emergency room when he saw an attractive female. He took a picture of her back side and posted it on Facebook. His message read, \"I like what I like.\" The woman was not identified and her face could not be seen.  The employee who posted the picture was fired and so was everyone that liked it.  On Thursday, Spectrum would only say that it \"Took appropriate action.\"  The Spectrum source tells WZZM that it was another employee who notified administrators about the posting.  Leek says it's a lesson for all; when it comes to social media, be careful what you say and always err on the side of caution.  Among those who were fired include a registrar, a physician's assistant, and an emergency room doctor. Not all were direct employees of Spectrum; some worked for a company that provided employees to the hospital.",
