  "summary": "The Dorn Veterans Administration hospital in Columbia says some personal information may have been compromised for about 2,000 patients.  The hospital said Monday that four boxes of pathology reports were reported missing from a locked area in the laboratory. The missing records are from 1999, 2000 and 2002.  The records were discovered missing in July when material was being prepared for shipment to a long-term storage facility.  The information includes name, Social Security number and pathology results for some patients.  Hospital director Timothy McMurry said the medical center is contacting veterans who might be affected.  The Veterans Affairs police and the VA Office of Inspector General are investigating.  Officials say there is no indication the information has been misused. But veterans are being offered one year of free credit monitoring.",
