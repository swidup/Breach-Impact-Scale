  "summary": "Veteran A was contacted by Veteran B who explained he had received an envelope from the Portland VA Medical Center containing his own paperwork as well as a Health Benefits form (VA 10-10EZ) that had been completed and signed for Veteran A. The Veteran complained to the facility Advocates Office, who notified the facility Privacy Officer (PO). Veteran B returned Veteran As document to the facility and it has been delivered to the PO.\nIt was explained to the PO that Veteran A completed and signed the form but instead of mailing it back to the facility he placed it in the return envelope that came with the form and dropped off the envelope unsealed in the facility Enrollment office. Since nothing had been written on the envelope and it was unsealed it was placed in a stack of empty envelopes. When Veteran Bs paperwork was mailed out, Veteran As document was not known to be in the return envelope that was sent with it.\nThe form contained personal contact, non-VA insurance, Medicare, financial information, and contact information for a next of kin.",
