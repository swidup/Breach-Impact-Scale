  "summary": "An unencrypted email potentially disclosed health information for over 500 patients in North Carolina.  For the second time in two months, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has experienced a health data breach due to an improperly encrypted email, according to WRAL.com.  The incident, which occurred in September, involves the health data of 524 state Medicaid patients. Although DHHS reports that the email that compromised the information was sent to the correct recipient, there is still the risk that the email was intercepted. However, DHHS added it has no reason to believe that the email was intercepted.  The health data breach disclosed various health information for Medicaid patients, including patient names, addresses, Medicaid recipient ID numbers, genders, ethnicity, race, insurance information, provider names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth.",
