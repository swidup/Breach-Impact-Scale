  "summary": "A manager's unencrypted laptop computer was stolen from the back seat of an employee's car.  The laptop contained the protected health information (PHI) of 841 individuals and included names, possible diagnoses, prescription names, dates of service, and service locations.  The covered entity (CE) has improved safeguards by encrypting devices and employing devices that do not allow local storage.  The CE has also revised its privacy and security policies and re-trained employees.  OCR has consolidated this review into a compliance review that involves the same corporate entity and another stolen unencrypted laptop. ",
