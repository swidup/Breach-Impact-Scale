  "summary": "A Veteran met with and notified the facility Privacy Officer (PO) that the Release of Information (ROI) office responded to a medical records request authorizing the disclosure of Urinary Analysis (UA) drug screen results to an attorney and an additional VA provider progress note was released with it. The release authorization did not include disclosure of any notes.  The note released indicated that the UA showed the Veteran had used methamphetamine. This note was presented in court and the Veteran lost custody of her children. The VA Provider created a later note explaining that the test results showed a false positive due to other medication the Veteran was taking, but this note was not able to be submitted to the court in time. The Veteran was informed that the incident would be investigated at a facility level and she may file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services as well. She met with the Patient Advocate to discuss filing a tort claim.",
