  "summary": "The Lubbock Cardiology Clinic bought an advertisement on the A-J Media website to announce a security breach in its Electronic Health Record system.  The advertisement reads, To the patients of Lubbock Cardiology Clinic, it is with regret that I must inform you of an unauthorized access into the EHR containing our medical records on Dec. 15 Jan. 30.  It prompts readers to click on the ad for further information.  The link contains a short letter claiming to be from Dr. Guy Wells, president of Lubbock Cardiology Clinic.  More than 1,400 medical records were affected, the advertisement reads.  This access viewed, copied, downloaded and exported medical records and patient demographics (names, addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers) without our approval, it reads. We are vigorously seeking answers and recovery of this information, and I am confident that we will be successful.  The letter is dated April 1.  A-J Media called the clinic on Thursday around midday.  A woman who answered the phone said patients can get information about the breach from their doctors. She said to contact Dr. Wells when he returns on Monday.  Patients with inquiries about their personal information can call 1 (888) 649-3557 and ask for the privacy officer or office manager.  ellysa.gonzalez@lubbockonline.com",
