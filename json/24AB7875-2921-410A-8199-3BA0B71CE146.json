  "summary": "On 11/1/12, a sensitive record access log was generated at VA Pittsburgh for routine monitoring and auditing. Two accesses by a VA Clarksburg employee were \nidentified as questionable. The access log was provided to the Clarksburg Information Security Officer (ISO) to investigate. At that time, it was determined the VA \nClarksburg employee inappropriately accessed the Veterans medical record. The Veteran and VA Clarksburg employee are allegedly brothers. On this date, the \nVA Pittsburgh Privacy Officer (PO) was advised of the findings and this incident is being reported for the first time.",
