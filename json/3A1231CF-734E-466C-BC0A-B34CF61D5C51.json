  "summary": "On October 9, 2015, we learned that documents containing information relating to some < < ClientDef1(Client Name)>> employees and some of their dependents could potentially be found through searches on the Internet. We immediately began an investigation and discovered that the documents may have been made available on the Internet when a vendor misconfigured security settings on the portal where the documents were stored. The portal settings have since been reconfigured and the documents are no longer searchable on the Internet. What information was involved? Our investigation has determined that the documents potentially made available on the Internet may have contained your name, address, telephone number, birth date, medical plan name, plan identifier and, in some instances, Social Security number. The documents did not contain any medical information such as claim information, test results or diagnostic codes.",
