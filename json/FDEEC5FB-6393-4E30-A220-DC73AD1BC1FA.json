  "summary": "District Medical Group in Arizona reported that 616 patients had PHI involved in a breach that occurred on March 1, 2014. A statement on their web site explains:  [_]  On October 24, 2014, we became aware that patient information was made potentially accessible on the Internet. We immediately began an investigation and learned that an employee used a thumb drive while working at home that contained patient billing information. While working from home, the employee connected the thumb drive to the home network, and a security vulnerability made the contents of the thumb drive accessible from the Internet. While connected, the documents and information on the drive could be located through a search engine, such as Google.  The thumb drive included patients names, dates of service, names of department where the patients were treated, refund amounts, and in some instances social security numbers. Credit card and banking information were not included on the thumb drive.  After we found out about this incident, we promptly took steps to remove the information from the Internet, including working to ensure the documents are no longer available through a search engine.  While we have no reason to believe that patient information has been used in any way, out of an abundance of caution, we began sending letters to affected patients on December 12, 2014, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions they may have.  If you believe you are affected but do not receive a letter by January 5, please call 1-888-266-9280, Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM Mountain Time.  We deeply regret any inconvenience it may cause our patients.  To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have taken a number of actions, including providing education to the involved employee and re-educating all employees regarding the protection of sensitive information.  In addition DMG is reviewing and updating pertinent policies and procedures regarding data privacy and security.",
