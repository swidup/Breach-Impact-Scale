  "summary": "A laptop computer that may have contained the files of more than 700 Coordinated Health patients was stolen from an employee's car on Feb. 21 and has not been recovered, according to a press release issued by Coordinated Health today. The laptop was stolen from the car of an employee in Bethlehem. The incident was immediately reported to local authorities with a formal police report filed. Coordinated hired a forensic investigator to conduct a full review of the content on the computer. While the laptop was password protected, the investigation revealed that the device may have contained an email with an attached file of 733 CH patient files, their social security numbers and their protected health information including (PHI): name, date of birth, address, insurance, appointment date and physician name. Coordinated has contacted the patients by phone and registered mail to alert them of the incident and assist them in any way possible. Coordinated is offering Experian's ProtectMyID identity theft monitoring, free of charge at http://www.protectmyid.com.  UPDATE: Number of patients affected was listed in HHS database as 13,907.  Record has been changed to reflect that update.",
