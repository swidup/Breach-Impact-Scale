There were no full-face/full-body images. The images should have been posted to a department directory with limited access. This was discovered by a Quality Management Nurse who was examining the file for another purpose. The Privacy Officer is attempting to correlate the image dates with the \npatient's appointment history in an effort to pinpoint the employee who posted to the wrong file.",
