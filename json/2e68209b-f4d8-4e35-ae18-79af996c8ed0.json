  "summary": "In late April 2017, The Neurology Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\") learned that an employee had been making unauthorized purchases using a company credit card.  On May 3, 2017, during the employee's exit interview, the Foundation further learned that the employee had transferred certain Foundation data onto a hard drive that the employee was storing in the employee's home.  The storage of Foundation data on external media is not permitted by the Foundation and the Foundation has since recovered the hard drive.  Upon learning of this incident, the Foundation immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, to determine the extent of the former employee's conduct.  During this investigation, on May 25, 2017, the Foundation determined that the former employee had, without authorization, transferred sensitive information onto his desktop, a hard drive, and several thumb drives.",
