  "summary": "Documents containing the member identification numbers for about 250 people enrolled in Humana Medicare Advantage plans in Wisconsin were stolen when an employee's vehicle was broken into, Humana said Friday.  The health insurer has been notifying the people this week and will issue new identification numbers and identification cards.  Also, a secure, encrypted laptop computer and files containing the name, date of birth and \"clinic name\" of an additional 2,550 people enrolled in Humana Medicare Advantage plans in Wisconsin were stolen, the company said in a news release.  Cathryn Donaldson, a Humana spokesman, would not explain what the term \"clinic name\" meant.  The company, she said, was not commenting beyond the statement.  The documents did not contain any Social Security numbers or financial information, Humana said. In addition, information on the laptop is encrypted and protected from external access, the company said.  Humana also is contacting the people whose names and birth dates were on the stolen documents.  \"At this point, Humana has no reason to believe that the information has been used inappropriately,\" the company said.",
