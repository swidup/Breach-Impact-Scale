  "summary": "Health data breaches due to misplaced flash drives seem to be a rising trend recently, as Lawrence General Hospital is yet another healthcare organization to report an incident. On August 7, the hospital put out a press release outlining the details of the data breach.  The flash drive was  reported as missing on June 9, and Lawrence General immediately began a thorough investigation, according to the statement. Lawrence General determined that the flash drive was last used in a hospital lab on June 6, and contained very limited patient information. The information on the flash drive included lab testing information such as patient names, lab testing codes, and slide identification numbers.  ",
