  "summary": "A document with 30 pages of neurology notes from a Veteran's medical record were mistakenly faxed to a public school instead of to the hospital who had requested them. The error occurred by one digit of the fax number being transposed. Upon receiving the fax, an employee at the school contacted our facility_s Release of Information office at the number provided on the fax cover sheet to report the error. We have requested the records be mailed back to the VA so we can account for their destruction.\nThe records faxed did not contain any information protected by 38 USC 7332.",
