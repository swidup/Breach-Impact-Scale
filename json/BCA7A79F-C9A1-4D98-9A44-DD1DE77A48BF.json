  "summary": "An employee reported that people other than her service chief had been checking her time and leave records. Employee spoke to her service chief about this issue and asked how they gained access to her timekeeping records. Her service chief told her that the Chief of A&MM had come to him to report on her time and leave and stated that Person A had asked him to have Person B look up the personal time and leave information. The timekeeper divulged her employee time record information to the Chief A&MM and also Person A. Neither the Chief A&MM nor Person A are her supervisors. Person A has accessed her sensitive records prior to this and though it was reported but nothing happened. Person A's access was taken away but he continues to get this information one way or another.",
