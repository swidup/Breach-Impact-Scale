  "summary": "An Occupational Health provider sent, via CPRS, a Progress Note from an employee's visit to the employee's supervisor. It appears the nurse provider did this in an attempt to keep the employee's supervisor informed of the employee's situation, since she was directed to go home for rest. This 2006 incident was uncovered as a result of an HHS Office of Civil Rights complaint, in which all unusual entries from the Sensitive Patient Access Report are being reviewed for allegations of inappropriate access by the employee's supervisors. In this case, a \"View Alert\" was recorded as being forced to the supervisor's work station, which was the Progress Note sent by the nurse provider.",
