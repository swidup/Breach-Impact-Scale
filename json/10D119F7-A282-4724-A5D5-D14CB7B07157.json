  "summary": "Hackers have reportedly stolen data of more than 600,000 Dominos Pizza customers. A group of hackers demand  30,000 before next Monday or they will make captured data public. The hacker group goes by the name Rex Mundi and claims to have hacked the websites of Dominos Pizza in France and Belgium. Theyve announced their hack in a Tweet and disclosed further details in an anonymous text file.  In the statement they write, We downloaded over 592,000 customer records (including passwords) from French customers and over 58,000 records from Belgian ones. Thats over six hundred thousand records, which include the customers full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords and delivery instructions. (Oh, and their favorite pizza topping as well, because why not).The group demands 30,000 to not disclose the information and to reinforce the threat they already posted samples of the stolen data. According to the hackers theyve contacted Dominos Pizza but the company has not responded to their demands so far.  A Belgian newspaper reports the company has contacted all affected customers and argues no credit card information has been compromised.Dominos Pizza has filed a complaint, but, according to the Belgian newspaper does not want to give in to extortion. This likely means that Rex Mundi will disclose the customers data next Monday.",
