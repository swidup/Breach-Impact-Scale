  "summary": "On 03/22/10, a VA Law Enforcement employee mailed a FedEx envelope containing Certification of Investigation forms for 2 contractors. The form includes the person's full name, date of birth, social security number, and level of clearance. The mailing label was addressed to the correct point of contact (POC), but had an incorrect mailing address. The envelope should have gone to DC. The envelope was received on 03/24/10 by the Financial Service Center (FSC) in Austin, TX. An FSC employee opened the envelope and didn't recognize the POC as working for FSC so he forwarded the envelope to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) in Austin. The AITC employee who received the documents turned them over to the AITC PO. AITC PO contacted the VA Law Enforcement employee who stated that the forms could be mailed to the POC in DC. AITC PO also spoke with Assistant Director of the VA Law Enforcement to advise him of the incident.",
