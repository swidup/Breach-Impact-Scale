  "summary": "True Vision Eyecare experienced a theft on Oct. 3 which included a laptop computer containing some patient information.  The only individually identifiable information available on the stolen laptop was the first and last name and spectacle lens order of some of the patients who have ordered glasses since July of 2013, the company said. The laptop did not contain any other individually identifiable information, such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, or telephone numbers.  True Vision is in the process of evaluating its practices and procedures to ensure that protected health information is more secure in the future, including that patient information is not downloaded to any laptop computer or other mobile device, unless the mobile device is password protected and encrypted, the company said in a press release.  The affected patients have been identified and sent notifications. For information, contact Dr. Anna Hopkins at 740-277-7550 or drannahopkins@gmail.com.",
