  "summary": "An employee from the Surgery Service accessed a veteran/employee's medical record and disclosed the veteran/employee's imaging test results to him that had been ordered by his Primary Care Provider. at the veteran/employee's request. After receiving the results, the patient then contacted his Primary Care Provider, stating that he had been told his x-ray results were critical and he needed to be seen by her right away. The PCP, concerned about who had accesed the Veteran's medical record to give him these results, notified the Administrative Officer who then contacted the Privacy Officer to conduct a sensitive record access review. After further review it was determined that a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) who knew the Veteran/Employee had accessed the medical record outside a need to know to do his job and therefore resulted in an information security and privacy policy violation.",
