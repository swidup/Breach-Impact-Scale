  "summary": "Some personal information of a few dozen Monroe County residents who are Medicare subscribers with WellCare Health Plans recently was mishandled by a subcontractor for the insurer.  In late November, WellCare sent letters to 47 people affected in Monroe County, telling them the breach did not include Social Security numbers or any financial information. The insurer notified more than 500 people throughout New York state who were affected.  The insurer said it was not aware of misuse of anyone's information. Nevertheless, it urged the 47 individuals to review their credit card bills and other financial statements. The insurer is providing one-year credit protection.  The breach was a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Crystal Walker, director of public relations, said WellCare learned on Nov. 3 that a vendor had a computer coding error, which caused denial letters to be sent to the wrong members. The information included the person's name, address, member ID number and general descriptions of the procedure, such as evaluation, radiology or administrative. No specific diagnoses were revealed.  When the error was discovered, WellCare sent postage-paid envelopes to the members who were believed to have received the inadvertent mailings.  Subscribers with questions can call WellCare at (888) 240-4946. UPDATE:  The number affected on the HHS site shows 4,469.  The record has been changed to reflect the new information.",
