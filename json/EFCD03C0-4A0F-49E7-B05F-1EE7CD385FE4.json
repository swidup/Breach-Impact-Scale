  "summary": "A Veteran stated he was brought into an exam room where the computer had not been locked and the previous patient_s information was still on. The Veteran explained repeatedly that if he had wanted to he could have hacked into our system and or tampered with patient information. He stated that he did not do this but did take down notes on the patient so that he had proof that the computer was left unattended. He took notes on his smart phone and then read the patient_s name, DOB, the date of his last C&P exam to the health information management (HIMS) supervisor and told her that the patient was right handed. He stated he was brought into the room by the nurse who then left him alone with an unsecure computer with patient information on it. The HIMS supervisor made him delete the patient_s information off of his phone in front of her.",
