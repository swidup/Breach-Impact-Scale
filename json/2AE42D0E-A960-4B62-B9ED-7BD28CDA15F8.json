Chester reported Friday.  The initial intrusion may have occurred as early as Sept. 28. The investigation began Oct. 1 after it was discovered that the MyID passwords of two UGA employees, both of whom work in sensitive information technology positions, were reset by someone unknown. The perpetrators then used those accounts to access data contained in university information systems holding personnel records, UGA said.  Accessed data included names, Social Security numbers aand other personal information. Current and former employees whose records may have been compromised will be notified directly by e-mail or U.S. mail as addresses are available for them, UGA said.  UGA also will provide credit monitoring for affected employees who ask for it.",
