  "summary": "MIDLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ANNOUNCES POTENTIAL PHI BREACH  Midland Memorial Hospital has announced that some of its patients' protected health information has potentially been viewed by unauthorized individuals.  On April 8, 2016, the Midland, Texas-based hospital was alerted to a privacy breach that exposed patients' names, addresses, dates of birth, medical diagnoses, medications, medical procedures, physician's notes, medical record unit numbers, medical account numbers, and health information. In some cases, patients also had their Social Security numbers exposed.  Patients' PHI was left unprotected at a private residence by Mario M. Gross, M.D., a physician who had previously worked at the hospital. The paper files were left in an area where they could potentially have been accessed by members of the public.  Once alerted to the security breach, staff from the hospital visited the residence and retrieved and secured the records. ",
