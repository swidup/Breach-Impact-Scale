Hospital officials confirmed that information was accessed on Sept. 18, a couple of days after a patient called to report that she believed an employee inappropriately accessed her health information. The employee  who worked for a staff physician  was fired on Sept. 19. Affected patients began receiving letters around Oct. 16. Officials said it took a while to alert patients because the hospital was determining who exactly was impacted.",
