  "summary": "A man without a photo ID was treated in the VA Emergency Department and his treatment was documented in the medical record of a Veteran with the same name on two occasions in December 2012. The man was not given medical records but he did have a patient wristband which had his name, full SSN, and date of birth printed on it. The Veteran's medications and general medical history would have been discussed with the man as part of the intake process for treatment. It has not been verified if the man claimed to have been the Veteran with the same name, or if the incident was caused by employee error.\nThe information collected is being relocated to the correct record.",
