The department's assurances that \"no classified data was compromised\" come as little comfort, however, considering the department's spotty security history.  \"It's a continuing story of negligence,\" Ed McCallum, former director of the department's office of safeguards and security, told the Free Beacon. \"[The department] is on the cutting edge of some of the most sophisticated military and intelligence technology the country owns and it is being treated frivolously by the Department of Energy and its political masters.\"",
