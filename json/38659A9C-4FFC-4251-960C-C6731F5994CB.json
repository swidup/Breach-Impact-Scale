  "summary": "Patient A received Patient B's prescriptions. Patient B's name, type of medication and address was compromised. A Consolidated Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) Business Associate who pre-sorts CMOP prescription packages prior to being placed in the mail stream labeled the package with Patient A's address. This incident has been reported to Parcelite for internal investigation and corrective action. UPS has been notified to return the package to the CMOP.  This is informational for Mis-Mailed CMOP incidents and is the representative ticket. There were a total of 6 Mis-Mailed CMOP incidents out of 7,720,362 total packages (11,404,886 total prescriptions) mailed out for this reporting period. Because of repetition, the other 5 are not included in this report, but are included in the \"Mis-Mailed CMOP Incidents\" count at the end of this report. In all incidents, Veterans will receive a notification letter.",
