  "summary": "On 01/15/14, around 10:00 PM, approximately twenty Veterans (Veteran A) called a VA Help Desk and reported they were able to see another Veteran's (Veteran B) information when they logged on to eBenefits. At this time it is known that Veteran's B name and mailing address were visible. Veteran A was able to access any of the information available in eBenefits for Veteran B, but it is unknown if Veteran A moved past the initial welcome page. VA IT Specialists are investigating whether or not logs can be pulled showing which pages were accessed. Approximately 10,000 users logged in to eBenefits on 01/15/14 so IT Specialists are investigating in attempt to narrow the time frame of when the incident began and ended. This ticket will be updated as information is received. NSOC opened a separate Remedy ticket to address the security issues. They did not create a PSETS ticket which is why this PO created this ticket. The NSOC ticket is VANSOC0601263.\n01/18/14 7:52 PM: Update to the incident description.\nVA Authentication Federation Infrastructure (VAAFI) was patching servers located at Terramark, without notification to Enterprise Operations (EO) or National Service Desk (NSD) when Veterans began contacting the eBenefits (EBN) Help Desk with reports of seeing other Veterans PII information being produced on their screens.
