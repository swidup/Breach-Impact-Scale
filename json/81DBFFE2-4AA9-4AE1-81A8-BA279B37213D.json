The Veteran was contacted to report the event and asked if she had received any documents. She had just received a package from the USPS that indicated that the envelope was lost in the mail and opened. They returned to her pages that were mixed up and pages were missing. We are sending her a fresh complete package by Fed Ex. However, her information is unaccounted for.",
