  "summary": "An EMS employee was in the cafeteria and found a packet of a patient's information/records folded sitting on the condiment bar. The employee gave this to their supervisor who in turn gave it to the PO. The PO contacted the head nurse of the ICU, where this patient was, and informed him of the incident. He looked the documents over and the items that were written on the records and stated it was a nursing student that would have written it. He is educating all the nursing students and letting the affiliate hospital know about the incident. The patient has since expired.",
