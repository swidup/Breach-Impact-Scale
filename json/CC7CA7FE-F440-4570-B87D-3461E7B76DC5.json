  "summary": "On Wednesday, 06/10/15, the Salt Lake City Regional Office (RO) was notified of an issue involving personally identifiable information (PII). The Wounded Warrior Program Office in Settle received a box from a Veteran in Anchorage AK (assuming it was the Veterans records). A Veteran had previously gone to the Anchorage RO and asked for a copy of her VA file and apparently left with a box containing PII of an unknown origin, and not her records. Upon receiving the box, the Seattle RO opened and reviewed the contents, what appeared to be primarily Human resources (HR) and payroll related, to include names and SSNs for VA employees, but other Veteran data was also present (name and SSNs).",
