  "summary": "VA Employee received an email stating that documents have been added to her eOPF file. Upon examination of the eOPF it was confirmed that the record did not belong to the Employee. The Employee notified Human Resources and her eOPF file has been locked. Further investigation is required.  The incorrect record was pulled from the eOPF and placed in the correct record. Employee whose information was in corrected posted was notified of the incident \nand informed that the information was removed and placed in correct record. It has been re-iterated to Human Resources staff that documents should be clearly \nseparated prior to scanning. Based on what occurred, we reasonably think this was an isolated, incident whereby someone inadvertently uploaded a record to \nwrong eOPF. The individual receiving the information is a trusted staff member who reported the incident immediately. We are requesting the case be closed.",
