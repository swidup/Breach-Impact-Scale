  "summary": "10News has learned of another security breach at one of the county's hospitals.  Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside admits that logs containing 35,000 patient names, dates of birth and diagnoses were wheeled out of the hospital on a cart.  The cart was being used by an ex-employee, who then drove the records home, before turning them over to the California Department of Public Health.         The hospital records of approximately 6,500 patients were removed without authorization from the premises of Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside on Aug. 8, the hospital announced.  A former employee took logs from the Emergency Department of patients who had been admitted to the hospital or transferred to other facilities between Dec. 1, 2013 and May 13, 2014. The records included: patients names, dates of birth, admitting physician, medical record number, diagnosis and admit date and time. The records, however, did not include Social Security numbers or financial information.",
