  "summary": "Community Hospital in McCook has told nearly 4,200 former patients that their identity information was contained on a laptop computer that was stolen in December.  Hospital officials say the laptop belonged to an employee of the hospital's auditing company, Seim Johnson, of Omaha, and that it was stolen in Nashville, Tennessee.  The hospital says Seim Johnson's subsequent investigation couldn't confirm that the laptop's encryption software was functioning. The hospital's health information manager, Rachel Berry, says the hospital is \"not aware of any activity that would make us believe the information has actually been accessed or viewed.\"  On Thursday Berry said all of the former patients notified are receiving a free year of identity monitoring.",
