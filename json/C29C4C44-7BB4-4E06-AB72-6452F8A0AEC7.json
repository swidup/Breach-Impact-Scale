  "summary": "More than 15,000 X-rays of Henry Ford Health System patients were stolen from a warehouse in May.  That's according to a letter the Detroit-based hospital system sent to patients.  The Detroit Free Press reports Monday (http://on.freep.com/12cXv1F ) thieves may have taken the X-rays involving 15,417 patients because of the silver that's contained in them.  Henry Ford spokesman David Olejarz says the silver interacts with radiation to allow for a clearer image.  The stolen X-rays were dated between 1996 and 2003. The letter sent to patients says names, addresses and dates of birth may have been included on the X-rays, but health insurance numbers and social security numbers were not.  Henry Ford officials on May 24 learned of the theft from a warehouse that's owned and operated independent of the health system.",
