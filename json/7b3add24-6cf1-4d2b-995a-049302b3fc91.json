  "summary": "Over 700 people received a notification letter about a privacy breach of personal information, the California Correctional Health Care Services said in a statement Friday. The CCHCS sent out 738 notification letters on Feb. 9 about a privacy breach of personally identifiable information and protected health information.  Investigators said a staff member inadvertently included a non-CCHCS employee email address in an email intended for internal use only.  The department sent an email to the unintended recipient requesting that person to confirm they did not read the email and did delete it. CCHCS received confirmation that the unintended recipient completed the requested actions. Under current federal law, any person whose unsecured protected health information was breached, or was believed to be breached, must be notified.",
