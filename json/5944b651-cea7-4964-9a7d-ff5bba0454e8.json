  "summary": "Baptist Health in Louisville, KY has notified 880 patients that some of their protected health information has potentially been accessed and stolen by hackers. The security breach was discovered on October 3, 2017, when irregular activity was detected on the email account of an employee. Baptist Health was able to determine that a third party sent a phishing email to the employee, who responded and disclosed login credentials allowing the email account to be accessed. Those login credentials were subsequently used by an unknown individual to gain access the email account. The email account contained the protected health information of 880 patients, although it is unclear whether any of the emails were viewed. The motive behind the attack may not have been to gain access to sensitive information.",
