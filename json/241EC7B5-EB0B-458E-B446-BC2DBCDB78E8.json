  "summary": "A Provider left a folder with her patients' information on the top of her car at home and drove off and it blew off the side of the street. Two individuals in the public noticed them as they drove by thinking they could have been important documents because there was a couple manila envelopes and there are a lot of lawyers that live around there. The documents included a practitioner's patients list which included 333 patients' first and last names and full SSNs, along with a few outside medical records that were going to be scanned into VistA Imaging. All 338 patients' full name and full SSN were included but there were 11 patients whose full name, full SSN, and other health information from other facilities were included. The individuals from the public called the Privacy Officer (PO) who went to their house and retrieved the documents. They said they are pretty sure they gathered all the pages that were around.",
