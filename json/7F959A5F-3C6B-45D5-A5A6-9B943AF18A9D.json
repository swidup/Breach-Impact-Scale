  "summary": "A total of 843 Blue Shield of California members had their personal information compromised during a data breach in May, officials said Thursday.  The personal information that was accessible during the breach included first and last name, Blue Shield identification number, date of birth, home address, and in some cases, Social Security number.  Coachella Valley residents were unaffected by the breach, said Sean Barry, corporate communications manager. However residents in other areas of Southern California were affected.  The breach occurred between May 9 and May 18, when three authorized individuals logged into their accounts on Blue Shield of California's secure health plan administrator website. The individuals were able to view Blue Shield member information associated with the account of another authorized user who accessed their own account at exactly the same time. The breach did not impact Blue Shield's public/member website.  The breach was reported to Blue Shield's Privacy Office on May 18, and the website was taken off line to identify and correct the problem. The website's problem was identified and it returned to service on May 19. Blue Shield has also implemented an additional code review that will help identify this type of vulnerability in the future.  Blue Shield is notifying all members who were impacted by the breach, all of whom will be offered a complimentary one-year membership to a product that helps detect possible misuse of personal information and also provides identity protection support focused on immediate identification and resolution of identity theft. A copy of the sample member notification letter can be found in the Office of the Attorney General's website  An unconnected data breach compromised the personal information of more than 4 million past and present federal workers.  Federal employees were told in a video Friday to change their passwords, put fraud alerts on their credit reports and watch for attempts by foreign intelligence services to exploit them, according to the Associated Press.
