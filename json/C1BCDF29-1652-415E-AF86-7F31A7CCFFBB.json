  "summary": "A nursing assistant from the Parkside Manor assisted-living facility in Kenosha, WI., has been fired for taking a video of a virtually naked 93-year-old Alzheimer's patient and sharing the file on Snapchat.  The latest case involved a video of an Alzheimer's patient who was recorded sitting on her bed wearing only a bra. Grace Riedlinger, 21, admitted taking the video without consent and sharing the file online. She is reported to have told her employer that the patient was \"giving her a hard time getting changed over for bed.\"  She said she took the video because the patient was \"was playing tug of war with her and she thought it was funny.\" The video was uploaded to Snapchat and was shared with her friends for a period of 24 hours via the \"story\" section of the website. One of Riedlinger's Snapchat friends reported her to Parkside Manor after seeing the video and an internal investigation was launched into the incident. That incident resulted in Riedlinger losing her job.",
