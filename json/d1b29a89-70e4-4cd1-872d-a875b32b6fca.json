  "summary": "Earlier this month, GHI mailed you a copy of your Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Evidence of Coverage (a document that describes the health care benefits covered by your plan and how your plan works). On October 13, 2016, we learned of an unintentional disclosure of your Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) as a result of this mailing. Our investigation found that, while preparing the Evidence of Coverage documents for mailing, HICNs were inadvertently included in the electronic file sent to EmblemHealth\u2019s vendor and were then disclosed on the external mailing label that was affixed to the package.",
