  "summary": "A Minneapolis Mental Health Clerk decided to reuse a large amount of scrap paper by having it cut up and bound into small notepads. The scrap paper appeared to be from Appointment lists, Health Summary reports and other documents. The backs of some of the pages contained the printed material, some of which contained patient names and the last 4 of their SSN. Approximately 100-150 notepads were recovered - it appears that very few of the pages contained sensitive information. A message has been sent out to Mental Health staff to destroy any remaining notepads by depositing them into the Shred-it bins. It is the Minneapolis facility's policy to shred 100% of all waste white paper.",
