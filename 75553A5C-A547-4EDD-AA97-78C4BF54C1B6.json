  "summary": "A security breach at the Florida Department of Health could have compromised the confidential medical records of five patients.  One victim said he learned about the incident Thursday, over a month after the documents were reported stolen to the Orlando Police Department.  An employee for the department had the documents in his vehicle at his home in what he said was a \"secured briefcase.\" The employee told police that his car was broken into on the night of March 31, and among items taken were the documents.  A report from the Orlando Police Department shows the health department knew about the incident on April 1.  One of the victims, Chris Kibodeaux, didn't learn until Thursday that his name, social security number, address, phone number and diagnosis, were among the things in the documents.  His diagnosis concerns him, being HIV positive, it's not information he wanted someone else to be in control of.  \"HIV is still a stigma,\" said Kibodeaux. \"It's different me telling my status because it's my personal tellings, but for someone to have that in the open, it's not right.\"  The letter Kibodeaux received said the employee was put on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, but the Department of Health said they could not comment on personnel issues.  Kibodeaux wants to know why it took the agency more than a month after filing a police report to notify him of the breach.  \"Someone could've definitely had enough time to do what they were going to do, and if there is damage it's already been done,\" said Kibodeaux. \"I'm going to have to pull my credit report and I'm going to have to try to figure out if someone has done something with my name.\"  The health department said Thursday that the records of five patients were stolen and they are still in the process of notifying all the patients.  They said they will be providing identify theft protection services for all the patients involved and they are committed to protecting the privacy of all the people they serve.",
