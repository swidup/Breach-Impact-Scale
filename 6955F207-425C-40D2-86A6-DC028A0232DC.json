  "summary": "Penn Medicine Tuesday announced a data breach involving receipts from Penn Medicine Rittenhouse that were stolen last month from a locked office in Pennsylvania Hospital.  Notifications of the theft were sent to 661 patients Monday, said Susan Phillips, a senior vice president and spokeswoman for the health system.  She said no arrests have been made. There have been no instances of identity theft related to theft. Phillips said that was a \"very low risk.\"  Many of the receipts were found on hospital grounds.  The receipts did not include social security numbers, diagnoses, insurance numbers or full credit card numbers. They did show varying information, including combinations of patient name, date of birth and the last four digits of credit card numbers.  Phillips said Penn is \"reviewing internal procedures to make any needed changes to keep patient informaiton confidential.\"",
