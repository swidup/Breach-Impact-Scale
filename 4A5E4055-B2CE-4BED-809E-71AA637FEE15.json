  "summary": "The state official overseeing Vermont's new online insurance marketplace says there has been a second \"privacy incident\" after there was a mix-up of information involving two people with the same first and last names. Department of Vermont Health Access Commissioner Mark Larson says the modification of one individual's account with another's information was the result of a manual mistake made by a customer service worker.  In October there was another incident in which two individuals had the same username, allowing one individual to access the other's account. Larson was criticized after the first incident because he failed to mention it to lawmakers during a committee hearing.  According to reports, the new problem, which occurred Friday, was reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
