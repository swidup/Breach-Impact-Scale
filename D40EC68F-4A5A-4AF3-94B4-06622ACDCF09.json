  "summary": "Birmingham VA Medical Center (BVAMC) Research Compliance Officer (RCO) was notified by BVAMC RN, Research Coordinator, that a consult form and imaging \nof a BVAMC patient was released to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) without proper authorization. A surgical resident released the information to the BVAMC RN, Research Coordinator (pulled from CPRS) who then provided the consult form and imaging to UAB research employee (who is also a WOC with VA Research). The UAB research employee stated she had obtained consent/HIPAA authorization from the patient. However, this had not occurred. The RN, Research Coordinator stated the image (burned to a CD) and consult have been destroyed/shredded as part of UAB's required action. The RN, Research \nCoordinator provided training to the UAB Study team, UAB research employee, and residents involved in this UAB study (which is not a VA study) on the proper \nmanner in which to refer VA patients to UAB for potential study participation and UAB consenting procedures.",
