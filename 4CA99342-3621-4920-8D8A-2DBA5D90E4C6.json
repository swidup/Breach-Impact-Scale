  "summary": "Veteran A contacted a pharmacy employee to report that he received Veteran B's refill slip in the package he had received in the mail from the pharmacy. The refill slip contained Veteran B's name, address and medication information. The pharmacy employee apologized to Veteran A for the error. The pharmacy employee then called Veteran B to advise him that his personal information had been inappropriately shared with another Veteran. The pharmacy employee did not report this to the Privacy Officer (PO). Today the PO received a notification from the Patient Advocate's Office that Veteran A had contacted them to express his concern about the lack of response from our facility to what he felt was a very serious situation. The Patient Advocate obtained the information regarding the incident from Veteran A and sent it to the PO for review and action.",
