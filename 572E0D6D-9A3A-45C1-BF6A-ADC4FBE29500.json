  "summary": "Midland Women's Clinic Notifies 717 Patients of PHI Exposure  On April 26, 2016., Midland Women's Clinic discovered that Gross had left information relating to 717 patients at his former residence according to a press release issued by the clinic.  Patients affected by the breach had received medical services prior to 2006 when Gross had last worked at the clinic. The records have now been retrieved and secured and the internal investigation has been completed. The documents contained names, home addresses, dates of birth, medical diagnoses, details of prescribed medications, and account numbers. Some patients' Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security numbers were also detailed in the retrieved documents.  The information was only left exposed for a limited period of time, but it was not possible to determine whether any PHI was accessed by unauthorized individuals. ",
