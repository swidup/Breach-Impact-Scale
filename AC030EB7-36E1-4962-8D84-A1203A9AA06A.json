  "summary": "A Minneapolis PC technician reported finding an .xps document saved to the desktop of a BCMA laptop. The document contained what appeared to be a Pharmacy Order. The order contained a patient name, social security number, date of birth and age, information regarding the prescription, Dates of Service, Physician name, comments and the Room/Bed #. The larger issue regarding this incident is that the information was available to anyone who may have walked by the computer. The BMCA laptops are configured with local _Service Accounts_ which permit a desktop to be presented as soon as the device is powered up. The applications are then accessed by clicking an Icon and logging in to the application. The document containing this sensitive information appears to have been created through one of the applications (CPRS, IMed Consent, etc) which allow reports to be printed to printers and to the Windows Desktop. Opening a document saved in this fashion does not require further authentication.",
