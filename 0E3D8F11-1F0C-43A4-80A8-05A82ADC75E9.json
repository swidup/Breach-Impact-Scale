  "summary": "Veteran A called the Portland VAMC and stated he received a letter from his PCP's office, dated 7/18/2012, reporting recent lab results. He turned the page over and found Veteran Bs medical record information on the back side of the page. Included in this other patient's information was his full name, date of birth, full social security number and specific medical record information, which Veteran A provided to the employee who received the call. From the description, the other patient's information was not in letter form (i.e. test results) but actual printed CPRS medical records. The caller indicated Veteran Bs information was printed on 7/17/12 at 18:33. There is a single page note from a VA provider to Veteran B that was electronically signed on the indicated date and time.",
