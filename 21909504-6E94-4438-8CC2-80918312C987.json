  "summary": "Patient A presented a request to the ROI office for a copy of his medical records but noticed later that night that he had received Patient B's records. Patient A notified the ROI clerk, who instructed him to shred the documents. Patient A's wife did not feel that was the appropriate response, so she contacted the VA for a second opinion. The information was shared with the Privacy Office on June 10. A phone call was placed to Patient A and he was instructed to return Patient B's medical records. Documents included Patient B's imaging reports, which contained name, social security number and diagnosis.",
