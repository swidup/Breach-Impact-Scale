The information included Employee Bs full name, date of birth, full SSN, address, and beneficiary information. HR Specialist immediately reported this breach to the eOPF Administrator.\nThe eOPF Administrator promptly accessed Employee As file and disabled her eOPF access until the file could be reviewed for accuracy. The SF-1152 for Employee B was removed from Employee As eOPF. The HR Specialist and eOPF Administrator verified that the SF-1152 was currently in Employee Bs eOPF. Employee As entire file was reviewed in order to ensure no additional documents were misfiled in her eOPF.",
