  "summary": "Officials said the security breach, which happened on June 6, prompted an internal review and the discovery of a second breach in 2012 in which less detailed information about more than 6,000 patients was mistakenly sent to job applicants. In both cases, the files were sent as training files to evaluate the skills of job applicants, Rady officials said.  The investigation revealed that a similar breach happened in August, November and December of 2012, when an employee mailed a file containing information on 6,307 patients to three job applicants as part of the evaluation process. That file had less information and did not include dates of birth, diagnoses, street addresses, or social security, insurance or credit card numbers. The hospital plans to notify the patients involved as soon as possible, Metcalf said.",
