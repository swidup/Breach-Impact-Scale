  "summary": "Parents of boy scouts in troop 221 are worried that their childrens medical records have been compromised, after a family van is stolen in Independence.  Kathleen Pace says she volunteers for her son`s boy scout troop and was in charge of gathering copies of the children`s physicals because they need them for Boy Scout camp this summer. Now they records are gone and because of that, the boys might not be able to go to camp.  Mark pace shows us where the family van was parked before it was stolen Saturday night.  He says thieves broke out the front window.  Our van was parked with the front wheels about at the edge of the concrete, said Mark.  William, 13, and his brother, Mark, heard pounding noise about 10:30 that night.  So we just went with the assumption that it was one of our dogs pounding his tail on the wall, said William.  It was the noise they heard next that led the boys to leap out of bed.  Then I heard the engine to our van I recognized it immediately. I was in bed trying to go to sleep so I jumped up to the window and saw the van driving away, he said.  Saturday night my son comes running into our bedroom saying, they`re stealing our van, they`re stealing our van, said Kathleen Pace, the boys mother.  What is most upsetting to Kathleen is what was inside the van; the medical records of approximately 70 boy scouts in her son`s troop.  So I notified the parents and they expressed concerns about identity theft and all of their information and fees for getting another physical, she said.  It is the fourth year troop 221 is signed up to go to boy scout camp in Osceola, but they need proof of their physicals to be able to attend, which were in the stolen van.  It`s a great concern and we are going to have to figure out how to resolve the problem of getting the physicals done so the boys can go to camp, said Kathleen. My hope is that someone will return them. I know people are good and they want to do things if they just know how to go about it.  The medical records are in a heart of America council plastic bag with other information on troop 221. If you happen to run across them, please return them to St. Mary`s Parrish. ",
