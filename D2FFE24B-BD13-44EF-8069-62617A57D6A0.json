  "summary": "Orlando (Fla.) Health is notifying patients of a data breach after discovering a nursing assistant had accessed patient records in a manner unrelated to job responsibilities.  The health system learned of the inappropriate access to information during a May 27 routine patient record access audit, according to a notice posted on its website.  The nursing assistant accessed patients' electronic records, which may have included patient names, birth dates, addresses, medications, medical tests and results, other clinical information and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Additionally, the employee may have accessed insurance information for \"a limited number\" of patients, according to the health system.  According to an Orlando Sentinel report, the data breach affects 3,200 patients. The hospital indicates the breach only affects certain patients treated from January 2014 to May 2015 at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and a \"limited number\" of patients at Orlando Regional Medical Center.  The employee has been fired from Orlando Health.  The health system says there is no evidence the information has been used or removed from the hospital, and it is still unable to determine the exact information the employee viewed or why the employee accessed it.  \"We are continually evaluating and modifying our practices and the practices of our employees to enhance the security and privacy of all confidential and protected health information entrusted to us,\" reads the hospital notification. \"We are also re-educating our workforce members and increasing our already vigilant program of auditing and monitoring of patient record access.\"",
