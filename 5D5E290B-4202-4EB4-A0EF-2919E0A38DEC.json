  "summary": "An employee received a notification that a document had been added to her E-OPF folder. She stated she went in to her electronic personnel folder to review the information and realized that the document belongs to another employee with the same last name. The employee to whom this document belongs had her name, full SSN and MN Board of Nursing license number on the document. Our Human Resources Department staff did not validate both first and last name prior to writing a SSN number on the document - which alerts the scanning staff which folder to put the document in to.",
