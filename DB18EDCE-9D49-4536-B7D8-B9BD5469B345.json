  "summary": "A Social Worker (SW) was training the staff at the Henderson Mill Annex including the Program Support Assistants (PSA) on how to read a spreadsheet so that \nthey could make appointments according to the protocol. All staff in the meeting had access to the spreadsheet because they either saw patients on the list or \nmade follow up appointments for them. The Social Worker did not know that one of the employees, a PSA, in the training was also a patient and she had him \nlisted on the spreadsheet with the other patients. The information on the spreadsheet included the PSA's last name, first initial, and protected health information \n(PHI) including clinic name, dates of appointments.\nAfter the training the PSA employee/patient sent many emails to staff making them aware of the spreadsheet and his name being contained there. The SW and \nMental Health (MH) Management apologized to the PSA and removed this type of information from the training format.",
