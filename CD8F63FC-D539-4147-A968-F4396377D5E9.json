  "summary": "On March 4, 2014, VFW received notice that an unauthorized party had gained access to the VFW's web server through the use of a remote access trojan and malicious code.  VFW removed the malicious code from its servers and terminated the hacker's access shortly after discovery.  VFW contracted with IT security professionals to analyze the breach, and found that the hacker had been able to download tables containing the name, address, and social security number of approx. 55,000 VFW members.  Based on other activity by the hacker, suspected to be from China, VFW has been informed that the purpose of the attack was not identity theft, but rather to gain access to information regarding military plans or contracts, and VFW has been in contact with federal law enforcement authorities regarding this potential threat.  We cannot be certain this was the only motive, however, and the hacker accessed the type of information that puts you at risk for identity theft.",
