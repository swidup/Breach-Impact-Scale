The letter stated why they were let go of their job due to not being able to perform the job duties due to the diagnosis. The Union asked for this information to be shared with the employee, not the Union as the Union saw this as a privacy violation because the Veteran didn't authorize VA to send the employee's medical information to the Union.",
