  "summary": "An investigation of a terminated employee revealed that there was a breach of patient Personal Identifying Information. A review of Employee A's Outlook inbox revealed that Employee A forwarded an Excel workbook containing PII of (31) Veterans to Employee A's personal AOL email account. The workbook contained full name, last (4) SSN, telephone contact information, home address and next of kin/emergency contact information. The workbook contained several tabs containing treatment plans for each individual patient in Employee A's workload. Several patients in Employee A's workload received letters requesting that they support the reinstatement of Employee A. The letters requested patients to write their name and last (4) of SSN in the body of the letter. Instructions in the letter requested that patients mail completed letters to VHA leadership.",
