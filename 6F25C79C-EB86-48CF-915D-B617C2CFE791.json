  "summary": "Dharani Jasthi DMD PC dba Today's Dental Associates reported that they:  received an anonymous fax after close of business on June 24, 2015. The anonymous source stated that it found a document containing names, ages, social security numbers and dates of birth of 6 of Today's Dental patients during a search of the apartment of a former Today's Dental employee and was notifying Today's Dental because the source understood it to be sensitive information.  Today's Dental promptly filed a police report with the Baltimore County Police Department. It is also taking steps to obtain background checks on new employees and secure its computer systems by assigning new passwords to employees who need to access patient records. Although we have no information that leads us to believe that the ex-employee took any action with respect to the personal information taken, it is possible that the personal information of the identified patients may be compromised.",
