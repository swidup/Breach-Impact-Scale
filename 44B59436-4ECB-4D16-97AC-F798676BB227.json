  "summary": "A laptop computer has been stolen from the Seton Family of Hospitals. The theft occurred on property that Seton leases at the Chevy Chase building, 7715 Chevy Chase Drive, from a secure office. A security camera captured video of the thief carrying out a laptop and projector and that information has been provided to the Austin Police Department.  The data captured on the stolen computer contains information from a shared database that is utilized by Seton as well as several other area healthcare providers to determine if patients seeking medical attention who are uninsured may be eligible for other funding sources.  Patients who sought care as part of an outpatient, clinic or ED visit since July 1, 2005, and presented without health insurance are those individuals whose information may be included on the stolen computer. After reviewing back-up data, current estimates indicate that approximately 7,800 individuals may be impacted. Seton is working closely with the other healthcare providers to notify all impacted patients.",
