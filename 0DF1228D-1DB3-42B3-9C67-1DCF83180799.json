  "summary": "A dental student tore pages out of a procedure/prep book which contains names, last four digits of the SSN, and the dental procedures of Veterans. When asked why the pages were torn out, the dental student replied that he put the pages in the burn box. Upon further investigation, it was found that the pages were not in the burn box and therefore it is questionable as to what happened to these pages. The student has since left the program.",
