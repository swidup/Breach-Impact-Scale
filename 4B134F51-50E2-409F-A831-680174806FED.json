  "summary": "Chicago police have located the hub of an identity theft operation and have arrested the two women coordinating the scheme.  Carmencita Kennedy, the reception at Woman to Woman Healthcare on the South Loop, has been charged with organizing a long-term financial crimes enterprise. Police say the 32 year old has stolen the identities of at least 26 women, all of whom were patients at the clinic.  Police also discovered that Kennedy was aided in the operation by Susan Byrd, who was spotted multiple times on surveillance footage at a Chase Bank. Byrd was caught withdrawing money using a fake ID that listed a patients personal data.  Both Kennedy and Byrd have previously been convicted of fraud.  Dr. Monica Moore, the owner of Woman to Woman Healthcare, is not believed to be involved. Her attorney issued a statement saying that she would cooperate fully with all investigative authorities to ensure that this matter is thoroughly investigated.  Police discovered the base of the crime ring after finding several similarities among the victims.  Patti Dalton, a detective for the CPDs Financial Crimes Unit, says she first noticed that all of the victims lived in the same vicinity. After that, it was only a matter of time before she learned they were all patients at Moores clinic.  In total, Kennedy and Byrd stole $125,000, say police. Chase Bank aided the police in stopping the operations and has compensated the victims. ",
