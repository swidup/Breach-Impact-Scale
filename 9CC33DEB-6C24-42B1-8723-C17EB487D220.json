  "summary": "Veteran A requested a copy of a note from his VA Medical Record from a clinic clerk but the note provided was not his. The Veteran did not realize this until he presented it to a Veteran Service Officer he was working with. The note provided to him was written by the same VA provider, but came from the medical record of Veteran B who shares the same last name and similar last 4 digits of his SSN. Veteran A brought the note to the VA provider to report the mistake and turned over the document. The provider reported the incident to the Privacy Officer and is sending him the original for his investigation file.",
