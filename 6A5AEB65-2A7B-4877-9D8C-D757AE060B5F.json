  "summary": "An anonymous hacker has breached the servers of Securus Technologies, a communications provider that logs phone calls made from US prison phones. The hacker has offered some of the stolen data to The Intercept, a website co-founded by Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer-winning journalist that published Edward Snowden's classified documents. According to data and details provided by the hacker, Securus had improperly stored 144 million phone calls on its server. After removing some of the duplicate data, the actual number was narrowed down to 70 million calls, made to 1.3 million phone numbers, by more than 63,000 inmates in 37 US states. The whole data amounted to 37 GB, consisted of calls made from December 2011 to the spring of 2014, and the hacker also claims that accessing it wasn't all that difficult. Out of all these calls, over 14,000 seemed to be private calls made between prisoners and their attorney. The US guarantees client-attorney privilege by law, which Securus broke by recording the conversation.",
