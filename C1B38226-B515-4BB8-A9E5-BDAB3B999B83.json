  "summary": "A hacker that uses the online moniker smitt3nz claims to have breached the website of the World Poker Tour Amateur Poker League (wptapl.com).  Cyber War News reports that the email addresses and passwords of over 175,000 users have been published online by the hacker. Unfortunately, the passwords are not encrypted.  Interestingly, some of the United States-based users whose credentials have been compromised have created accounts with government email addresses.   There are email addresses belonging to employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the House of Representatives, US Courts, the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor.  Hopefully, they dont use the same passwords for their email accounts.   The hacker highlights the fact that close to 47,000 of the users whose information appears in the leak have the default reset password assigned by the World Poker Tour Amateur Poker League. ",
