  "summary": "On 02/03/11, the Eligibility Coordinator entered a backlog of approximately 2000 patients into the Enrollment Applications System (EAS), which is a national \nelectronic VistA file that dates back to 2002. Some patients have made address corrections since the original application was completed. The application \noverwrote the current data and resulted in incorrect patient addresses in the system. This impacted the pharmacy prescription mailings and patients have been \ncomplaining that they have not received their medication. Pharmacy, Information Technology Staff, and others are currently reviewing the entire process to \ndetermine the extent of the patient information exposure and mismailed medications.",
