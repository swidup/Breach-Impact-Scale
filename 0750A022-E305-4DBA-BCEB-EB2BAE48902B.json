  "summary": "Veteran A had an appointment with his medical provider. He left a pamphlet in the exam room. Folded inside the pamphlet were paper copies of his lab results. Veteran B had an appointment with the same medical provider. The nurse who prepped the exam room found the pamphlet and assumed it belonged to Veteran B when in fact it belonged to Veteran A. The nurse did not see the folded lab papers and thought she was only mailing the non-sensitive informational pamphlet. Veteran B received the pamphlet in the mail and discovered the lab results paperwork and contacted the facility to report the issue.",
