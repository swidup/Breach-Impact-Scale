  "summary": "Data collected on one VA Research subject screening form containing protected health information (PHI) was disclosed to a non-VA database for the study before authorization had been obtained from the subject to use or disclose his information. This disclosure occurred on 05/21/12 and was discovered when the study was being reviewed in late June 2012. The study protocol is overseen by the VA Central Institutional Review Board (IRB) but the mistake occurred at the Portland VAMC by researchers working with the local Principal Investigator (PI). The University maintaining the database has already deleted the form data entered for affected subject.",
