  "summary": "A Veteran's VA Provider contacted the facility Privacy Officer to discuss the Veteran's desire to revoke authorization he had signed allowing his mother and father from communicating with his providers about his treatment. The Veteran will be submitting a written request to revoke his authorization. The Privacy Officer checked the medical record access log for this Veteran because of the confusion surrounding access to his information and discovered that his VA employee step father had accessed his record on two occasions since January of this year. The Veteran's record does not indicate he has been treated in his step father's department during this time so he likely did not have a need to know.",
