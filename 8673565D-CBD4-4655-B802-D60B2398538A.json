  "summary": "Group Health Incorporated (GHI), which merged into Emblem Health, recently reported to HHS that 802 insured members were affected by a breach involving paper records. In a statement dated August 21 on their web site, Emblem Health explains:   EmblemHealth is notifying approximately 800 GHI members about a privacy breach that was discovered in July 2014.  On July 3, 2014, it was discovered that checks and explanations of payment documents intended for a radiology provider were sent to an incorrect address as a result of a manual data processing error whereby two numbers in the providers billing address were transposed. Statements processed during the period of June 13 to July 8, 2014 intended for the provider were inadvertently sent to the incorrect address. These documents included the members name, health plan identification number, dates(s) of service and certain other claims-related details. The members Social Security number or financial information were not disclosed.  Protecting our members personal information is a responsibility we take very seriously, said Suzanne Ronner, Vice President, Customer Experience. We have taken immediate steps to help prevent this from happening again.  Upon discovery, the incident was promptly brought to the attention of EmblemHealth and corrective actions were taken to correct the providers address. All affected individuals have been identified and notified. The company is not aware that anyones information has been inappropriately accessed or improperly used as a result of this incident.  Members who received a notification letter and have questions about a claim or benefit may call the Customer Service number on the back of their ID card. Representatives are available to help members from 8 am to 8 pm, seven days a week.",
