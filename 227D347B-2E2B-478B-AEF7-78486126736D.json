  "summary": "On July 6, 2012 a VA Employee Veteran who is treated at our facility received a letter from the Portland VA Eye clinic that was postmarked July 2, 2012. The\nstreet address was hand-written on the envelope and the house number was incorrect so the letter was returned to the post office. The post office was able to identify the error and deliver the letter. The adhesive on the envelope flap had failed, so the envelope appeared open. The Veteran is concerned that their information was seen.\nThe clinic letter included the Veterans full name, full social security number, full date of birth, her eyeglass prescription, and mention of a missed appointment in the clinic. The home address on the envelope was incorrect by one digit.",
