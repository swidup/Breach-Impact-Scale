  "summary": "Approximately 3,900 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center patients will be getting letters alerting them that some of their personal health information may have been breached after a physican\u2019s personal laptop computer was stolen from a hospital office.  The theft occurred May 22, hospital officials said Friday, and the stolen laptop, which contained a tracking device, has not been recovered.  \u201cThere were no Social Security numbers, there were no complete medical records, and there were no medication lists\u201d on the laptop, said Dr. John Halamka, Beth Israel Deaconess\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cThere was also no financial data, and nothing that would be used from an identity theft perspective.\u201d  Beth Israel Deaconess routinely protects information on company-issued computers by encrypting the material with software that makes it difficult to decipher, but in this case the stolen laptop was the physician\u2019s personal device that was used for some office work.",
