  "summary": "Security camera video shows a hospital employee entering a patients room and then using the patients credit card at a liquor store and gas station.  Round Rock Police arrested 46-year-old Carol Ann Parks, an employee of St. Davids Round Rock Medical center, on two charges of credit card abuse.  According to the hospital, Parks was employed as a part-time patient care tech for less than one year, but she has since been terminated. Parks main duties were related to daily living such as skin care, feeding, hygiene, mobility and personal needs.  According to police, it all started when a woman was hospitalized and later contacted by her credit card company inquiring about some suspicious transactions. Detectives worked with hospital personnel to learn other patients staying at the hospital also had credit cards stolen from their personal belongings. Police believe there are at least 2 other victims.  Sgt. John Row with the Round Rock Police Department says, Credit card abuse is pretty ramped right now especially right around Christmas time and with the elderly. This person specifically targeted elderly patients and thats pretty low.  Detectives obtained the surveillance video from the hospital that showed Parks entering one of the victims rooms after her shift ended. Then, they obtained the video showing parks using the card at a liquor store and a gas station.  In a statement to KXAN News, the hospitals Chief Operating Officer, Tad Hatten issued the following statement:  Patient safety and security are ALWAYS our top priority. We are confident that we took the proper precautions with this employees hiring, and we are equally confident that the police and the justice system will ensure that the case is investigated fully and brought to a just end. Parks was booked into the Williamson County Jail and faces 2-10 years in prison if found guilty. ",
