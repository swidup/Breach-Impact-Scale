  "summary": "Molina Healthcare said Friday personal information on some of its 5,261 former members was inadvertently mailed out to individual households via postcards in mid-March.  The postcards contained a tracking number that included Social Security numbers  although not names  of individuals and sent to former Molina members, the company said in a news release. The numbers were not identified as Social Security numbers but were unlabeled data on the cards. The information was sent out by a printer contracted by the company.  Molina said it was unaware of any misuse of the information and that it is notifying the affected individuals and offering them a year of free identify protection services.  Members or former member with questions can call Molinas member service department at 800-580-2811 or TTV 800-659-8331",
