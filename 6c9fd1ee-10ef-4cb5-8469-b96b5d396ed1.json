  "summary": "This past February, several employees and other individuals at Florida\u2019s Martin Memorial Health Systems allegedly used their cell phone cameras in the emergency department to photograph the injuries of a shark attack victim who later died. After an investigation into possible HIPAA violations, the hospital attributed the actions to poor judgment rather than malicious intent. Disciplinary actions ranged from written warnings and suspensions to demotions and academic probation for paramedic students. No one was fired.",
